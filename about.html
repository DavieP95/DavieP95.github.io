<p>David Polanco is a graduate of Lehman College where received his Bachelors of Science in Exercise Science (Pre-Physical Therapy). He got experience in the healthcare field by volunteering in the BxCHL program in Montefiore's FHC in Fordham Road in the Bronx. He worked in a private Physical Therapy clinic in the Upper east side in Manhattan as a Physical Therapy aide for about 3 years. He was always interested in technology and learned about coding through an app called mimo. Having seen that the healthcare software was difficult to navigate and sometimes complicated, he decided to embark on a journey to learn to code. He desires to make an impact on the way doctors interact with software, patients receive care, and to also join a team passionate about people's physical health. </p>
